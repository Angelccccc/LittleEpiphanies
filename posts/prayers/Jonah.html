            God, it can be so difficult doing the things you want us to do. In some ways I am similar to Jonah, but I don't want to be. I really hope you can help me hear your voice and give me the courage and strength to do the tasks you ask of me. Amen.

            Sometimes I don't do what I need to do. Sometimes I hear your voice but don't act upon it. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. But I still want to be beside you and continue being your child. Thank you for still wanting me and forgiving me for all my sins.
            Amen.

            God, you send us through times of trouble so you can test us and see if we turn to you. I want to have an obedient heart that listens to you, but I sometimes stray away and lose sight of you. Soften my heart Lord with worship and praise. Help me to listen and act upon your words. Amen

            Wow, God, the way Nineveh acted after hearing the news. They believed in your message and took action right away. I want to be like that. To hear your message and act upon your message instantly. God, I am a sinner and I want to repent and live blamelessly in you. Amen

            I really don't know how you stand us, God. After all, we are all sinners, but God I'm so grateful that you continue loving us and showing mercy because there indeed is no hope if your mercy didn't exist. I want to get happy in you, Jesus, I want your love to overflow from me, and I want to part of your great plan. Amen
