        <h1>A Home</h1>
        <article>
            <p>
                There once was a girl who built her home in a cave. It was a quaint place, not particularly big. There
                was a little balcony at the front of her steps, and inside it was cozy. A fireplace sat in her living
                room, surrounded by shelves upon shelves of books. The furniture had a rustic, vintage feel. She made
                sure that every room was precisely decorated, matching couch pillows with blankets, matching chairs with
                tables. It was her own little paradise and there she developed her own routine. She woke up at roughly
                the same time everyday anywhere from 6 to 7am. She ate her breakfast of toast and then got to work. She
                had lunch at the expected time, and after work she would settle down with a book by the fireplace--that
                was her world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sporadically people would show up at her door. For certain people she would open the door and have a
                conversation: they would talk about the never changing weather inside the cave or they would talk about
                their mundane days. For those she cared about more she would talk with them and exchange gifts, a bag of
                rice for a bag of flour, some apples for some oranges. Once in a while for those she deemed special she
                would gift them with homemade cookies and dishes.
            </p>
            <p>
                That was her world until one day a man showed up at her door. He wasn't any different from any of the
                wandering visitors. He wore the usual clothes, his hair was styled the same. He was ordinary. She opened
                her door and they had a conversation. Everything proceeded typically, until she noticed that he showed
                day after day at her door. Every evening she would hear a distinct knock and she knew it was him, and
                every time she would open her door.
            </p>
            <p>
                One day, after their usual conversation and their exchange of gifts, as she was walking away from her
                door, she decided to look through the peephole. He was still standing there with nonchalant ease. She
                slowly unlocked her double bolted door and opened it revealing half her body, sorry, I noticed you
                standing here, is there something I can do for you?
            </p>
            <p>
                There was no judgement in his voice, only curiosity as he asked, will you ever let me in? Hesitantly,
                she opened her door wide and stepped aside, allowing him into the comfort of her home.
            </p>
            <p>
                He stepped inside, took his shoes off by the door, hung up his outdoor jacket. He stepped further
                inside, taking in his surroundings. His eyes scanned every decor, seeing the care she put into her home,
                however, alongside the good, he also saw the flaws. The stain on the ceiling, the dust collecting on the
                window sill, the furnace that made crackling noises. She hadn't let anyone in before. In a way, it was
                out of fear, she didn't want someone to see her flaws and leave, yet at the same time she was
                comfortable keeping them outside on her front steps, it was easier and it was all she'd ever known.
            </p>
            <p>
                He showed up the next day and with each day, she let him further into her home, and he saw more of
                her--the good and the bad--yet with every encounter he kept showing up. They settled into a routine of
                their own. She would cook them dinner and he would bring the ingredients. They talked about everything
                their minds wandered to.

            </p>
            <p>
                One normal evening, they were sitted on her couch. His arms were wrapped around her. Her head rested
                firmly on his chest. There were two cups of tea sitting on the coffee table. The fireplace gave sporadic
                crackling noises. He spoke, his voice soothing and calm, did you know there is a world where light
                shines naturally in the morning and at night stars scatter themselves across the dark expanse? She
                didn't believe him at first, thinking that he was a dreamer and there was nothing more to it, but she
                looked into his eyes and he was somewhere far away. His eyes gleamed with knowledge of a better world.
                She could do nothing but believe him.
            </p>
            <p>
                She asked, how do I get there? I don't know the way? I wouldn't know how to survive in a different
                world.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'll show you. He said, extending his hand out. She put her hand in his and together they ran out of her
                home in the cave. The further they got from her home, she smelled a freshness in the air, she saw light
                at the end of a tunnel. It scared her, but his hand was guiding her, his confident stride eased her
                worries. When she took that first step out, her breath caught in her lungs. She saw that he wasn't
                lying. There were specks of light and it filled the sky. There were trees taller than she could imagine.
                He led her to a field and they lay in the grass, watching the sky. As the morning came, the sky was
                flooded with colours: red, purple, orange, blue, more colours than she thought possible. He pointed to
                an object peaking its way past the horizon, that's the sun and it provides all the light. It allows the
                trees to grow. She looked at the sun and then she looked at him and she decided that he was her sun. Her
                source of comfort, her light in the darkness.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't think I could ever go back, she stated as she took in her new world.
            </p>
            <p>
                You don't have to. He said. Come with me, I want to show you an amazing spot. He led her to a meadow
                filled with blossoming wild flowers.
            </p>
            <p>
                She smiled at him, at her sun. I think this is it. I want to build my new home in the meadow. So
                together they built her a little cabin, as cozy as was previously, but there was a lightness to the
                home. It could've been the choice of wood--birch. She changed up the colour scheme of her decor, but the
                similarities were still there. The home followed the same layout. The fireplace was surrounded by books.
                There were new additions gifted by her sun.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the home was nearly complete, with only the final touches missing, he said to her, I'm sorry, but
                my time here is up, I have to go somewhere far away.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was sadness in her voice, okay, if you must I won't stop you. They held each other one last time
                and then he set off into the distance. She was filled with quiet melancholy, a persistent throb in her
                heart, but she knew that his brief stay changed her life, so she didn't sulk for long.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the meadow more visitors came, this time she gladly let them in. Her doors were never locked, some
                visitors stayed for a meal, some helped her finish up her home, some brought her gifts. She settled into
                this new routine, a home that was never quite empty, a home filled with people of all variations. She
                loved it. It was her new paradise.
            </p>
            <p>
                There were inconveniences never encountered before. A clumsy hand that spilled wine on her favourite
                carpet, a vase shattered by a ruckus visitor, an item stolen by a trusted guest. There were moments of
                hurt and sorrow, but it never stopped her from enjoying her paradise. She continued letting people in.
                She still loved it.
            </p>
            <p>
                That was her world until one day a man showed up at her door. He was similar to the many other visitors
                that passed by her door. However, his clothes were a little more foreign, and his hair was styled a
                little different. She felt curiosity towards his differences, so she opened her door letting him inside.
                He left a trail of mud in her hallway. He kept his outdoor coat on.
            </p>
            <p>
                She comforted herself knowing that his stay wouldn't be long. When he left, she quickly got to cleaning
                her home. The next day he showed up again and again and again. Her door wasn't locked, so he let himself
                in and each time he left a mess in her home. He left her windows opened, letting in the flies. He
                brought in his dirty shoes, leaving dirt on her floors. He cluttered up her paradise. He ate her food,
                took her books.
            </p>
            <p>
                She soon exploded, get out! Get out and don't come back!
            </p>
            <p>
                But the next day she heard a knock and there he was standing at her door, asking for forgiveness, asking
                for another chance.
            </p>
            <p>
                She sighed, okay, but please be respectful of this place. She moved aside, letting him in again.
            </p>
            <p>
                This time he took off his shoes. He hung up his coat. And he started taking more care of her home. And
                with time, the past hurts were forgotten and they settled into a new rhythm with each other. He showed
                up day after day, sometimes bringing her new books, sometimes new foods and she would cook for him, make
                him tea, read him stories. There were moments when she looked at him and he resembled her sun, but
                because no one could do what her sun did for her, she decided that he would be her moon, her stabalizer.
                Her moon stayed far longer than her sun. And her moon went far deeper into her home than anyone. He saw
                far more of her virtues and her flaws, yet he kept showing up. He touched every crevice and hidden
                corner of her home in the meadow. She felt love beyond words, she felt attraction far beyond anything
                she had experienced with her sun. She loved her moon.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, as old habits started appearing the more comfortable her moon got. He often left a trail of
                mud, clothes scattered in the bedroom, dirty dishes in the sink. He showed up with less gifts. He
                started restraining her, he wanted dinner cooked precisely to his liking, he wanted the fireplace
                providing just enough warmth. She loved him so she ignored his flaws and tried her best to accommodate
                him, but with every encounter there was something she didn't do and with every encounter she was
                suffocating in her home in the meadows. There wasn't a single moment he wasn't there. She could feel her
                sanity leave as her cabin became more cluttered with his items, with his wants and desires, with him.
            </p>
            <p>
                And one day she snapped, she spoke with tears in her eyes, could you please stop taking so much, I can't
                do this anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
                But her moon didn't comfort her like he did in the past. He demanded, what have I taken? I have given
                you so much. I have given you all my time.
            </p>
            <p>
                They screamed at each other. There was no understanding. Fits of rage were thrown, awful words were
                spoken. And in their anger, a candle was knocked over into a curtain, engulfing it in an instant. They
                both ran for the kitchen, attempting to douse the fire with water, however, their attempts were futile.
                Her moon noticed and he left her by herself as she splashed bucket after bucket of water onto her
                burning home in the meadows.
            </p>
            <p>
                The smoke choked her, her eyes burned. She realized her helplessness and left. The stars that once
                provided her with joy, now felt like they were taunting her, laughing at her misfortunes. Across the
                great expanse of darkness, her home in the meadows burned, a great flame reaching towards the heavens.
                She watched the flames and vengeful anger filled her blood. Fire reflected in her eyes and anger was all
                she knew. She hated her moon. She hated him. She hated the very essence of his being.
            </p>
            <p>
                She remained with hostility in her veins until the last of the flames died down. The sun rose,
                reflecting its light onto the ashes that once was her home in the meadows. She felt tears drifting down
                her face, she tried so desperately to hold it in, but it consumed her. So she lay in the meadow, formed
                herself into a ball and cried. She cried for the loss of her moon. She cried for the loss of her home.
                She cried for her own idiocity. She cried for many days until her body had no more water to give, until
                her stomach was screaming for food, until the wild grass around her had grown inches taller. Tears had
                tried on her cheeks, her hair was a mess, but she finally got up. She felt her legs wobbling. She pushed
                through and continued putting one foot in front of another. She didn't know where she was going. All she
                knew was that she had to get away. She needed to be gone from all the good memories, haunting her mind,
                telling her she threw away something wonderful.
            </p>
            <p>
                She wondered for a long time, until she stumbled upon a dark opening. There was faint nostalgia in the
                air. Her home in the cave was at the end of the tunnel. She felt her body take one step forward and then
                another, but then she collapsed. She was sitting on the ground, legs at awkward angles. More tears came
                to her eyes. In her home in the cave it was safe. No one came in, no one destroyed her carpet, her mugs,
                her books. No one destroyed her. She hated her sun for showing her what more the world could provide.
                She hated her sun for taking her hand. She hated her sun for leading her to the meadow. She hated her
                sun because she knew that she could never go back even though it was safer, even though her heart longed
                for it. There was too much beauty out in the world. There were too many joys.
            </p>
            <p>
                She got up, dusted the dirt from her clothes and turned away from the cave.
            </p>
            <p>
                She wandered by a lake, a valley, a desert, a mountain wondering where to settle. However she stopped in
                a forest. It felt right. So she built herself a new home in a forest.
