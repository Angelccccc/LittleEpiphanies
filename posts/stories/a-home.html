        The city didn’t quite wake so much as it stretched—slow and soft—while the first light
        pooled along the window ledge. Coffee steamed, a small weather system in a chipped mug,
        and the room settled into that gentle hush where thoughts arrive unannounced.

        I wrote a few lines, crossed them out, and smiled at the empty page for being
        patient. Some days that’s enough: a quiet morning, a promise to try again,
        and the sense that life keeps unfolding in its own calm tempo.
